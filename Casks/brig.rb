  caveats <<~EOS
    On Linux, brig drives nerdctl and needs nothing else.

    Guest images are verified with cosign before boot. An image brig-sh did
    not publish is reported and booted anyway. One that claims to be ours and
    fails verification stops and asks.

    Start with:
      brig run claude
